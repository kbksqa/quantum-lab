- Repository created. Goal for P0: implement Grover search from primitive gates (no library oracle
  helpers), verify the amplification behaviour on a simulator, then run the same circuit on real
  IBM hardware and compare the two distributions.
- Question P0 must answer: how far does the hardware result drift from the ideal distribution, and
  does that drift grow with the number of Grover iterations?
